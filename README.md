# Currency Converter

This React-Native app is based on the tutorial given by Spencer Cali, on his website [free video course](http://learn.handlebarlabs.com/p/react-native-basics-build-a-currency-converter)

### Tech
The original course was based on react-native 31. While installing, I decided to upgrade all the tech-stack to the latest versions. Doing so, there were a few places I had to update the code.
- [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)
- [react](https://reactjs.org/)
- [redux](https://redux.js.org/)

### Installation

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm run ios
```

### Development

Want to contribute? Great! There are a few things in my to-do list for this app, I am not equipped for those implementations yet. I am learning steadily and getting myself more familier with the tech-stack and in due time I'd be able to scratch the items off the list.

### Todos

 - Write Test-Cases
 - Implement two-way conversion without, essentially making the 'reverse' feature unnecessary
 - Filter to the currency lists
